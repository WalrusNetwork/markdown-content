# **The Walrus website is live!**

### On our website, you’ll find access to the following:

- A live state of our game servers and running matches
- A calendar of regular events
- Access to our Shop
- Individual player profiles loaded with great statistics (stay tuned!)
- Public leaderboards and ladders for all of our games
- Player resources, such as our helpful Guides sections, listing FAQs and our Map-making corner
- Our Player Rules across services
- Our Terms of Services, Privacy and Cookies policies
- Our current Job Postings
- Blog posts and regular updates such as this one! We’ll be announcing our daily feature release in a blog post here as well, so check back regularly.

Our goal is to have all of these features up and running by our Beta release date, which is to say January 1st. As you’ll see, some of these features are already up, while others are still in the pipeline – please be patient with us as we get everything ready for the 1st!

If you notice anything on our website that looks off, please reach out to one of our staff members in the [Walrus public Discord](https://discord.gg/eySJYEb), [Tweet us](https://twitter.com/@walrusnet) or find us [on Instagram](https://instagram.com/walrusinsta). Or if you want to tell us just how great it looks, that’s fine too.

Thank you to our web developers, particularly Indicado and ALM, for getting the website up and steady, as well as our Marketing folks for the content & graphics! Special thanks to graphic designers [Elusiveblank](https://twitter.com/elusiveblank) and [Fleuor](https://twitter.com/lineticartworks) for the artwork, as well as [Strangey](https://twitter.com/Strangeys) and [Anbu\_](https://twitter.com/anbuXD) for the banner.

Keep an eye out as we progressively unveil new content on the daily!
Yours truly,

Walrus
