Hello everyone,

Today we're excited to explain how we'll be integrating queues, matches, as well as a party system, on our game servers!

### **Queues**

Imagine multiple games available on Walrus, starting during our Beta with UHC, Arena, and our selection of Ares gamemodes.
Players will have the ability to **queue** for a given **match**. If you want to play, say Ares, you will have the ability to queue for this game-type, and then be ported to either a running match, if there are still spots left in either team, or a new match once a sufficient number of players are queued for the match.

### **Matches**

Players in the match will be able to vote among three suggested maps, to pick out which map will be played next. The system will suggest these three maps based on a variety of factors (what gamemodes were just played? Is there an increase or decrease in the number of players? etc.). Once a map has been chosen, the players will be ported to their new match.

### **Parties!** ðŸ¥³

Lastly, we're excited to announce that parties will be integrated into this queue system! Players from the same party will be placed in the same match. All regular players will be able to start parties of at most five players. The party system will be integrated across our games, whether Ares, Arena or UHC (team UHCs might use the party system for teams, although parties would not be taken into account for solo UHCs).

On Ares, of the five players in a party, at most three will get matched onto the same team. If you have a party of five, the system will do its best to match three players on the same team, and two on the opposite team.

On Arena, players of the same party will have the ability to play against players of other parties in team-fights, whether Ranked or Unranked.

All in all, keep an eye out over these coming days on how premium perks will come into play in this all...

That's all for today. Merry Christmas Eve!

Walrus
