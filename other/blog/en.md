Yesterday we gave you a preview of what maps we will have available for private servers when they are released during the Beta, so today we want to give you insight into our process for selecting maps that will be available for **public servers**. If you missed yesterday’s post, you can check out the maps on private servers [here](https://gist.github.com/mitchts/6d7054b14eeef8c6ae7e1bd04dcc4ec1).

### **Quality Over Quantity**

Here at Walrus, our primary focus is to help grow the competitive Minecraft landscape, so it only makes sense that our primary focus would be on maps designed specifically for competitive gameplay. Instead of splitting the focus of our gameplay team between two starkly different demographics and styles of gameplay, we will gear ourselves towards maps that cultivate competition, while still promoting newer-player skill growth, allowing us to provide a much higher quality pool of maps

In order to support this focus on competitive, we aim to provide a smaller pool of higher quality maps rather than a larger pool of underdeveloped maps. A smaller pool, however, does not mean a lack in variety. We will still aim to offer a wide selection of maps with varying focuses on gameplay and style, but will simply be selective in which maps we provide. We want to accompany map-makers throughout their creative process to ensure a well-refined end-product.

### **Standardization**

In order for Walrus to maintain a high-quality pool of maps, many commonalities between maps are being standardized in a way that makes sense for both the players and the gameplay of the map. The absence of standards across maps makes for a bunch of tiny implementations that are map-specific, which we want to avoid. Without standardization, things quickly get complicated for players, the map-makers and our team of level designers. Some will be less noticeable than others, but below are a few big ones.

#### **Items**

Spawn kits, particularly in conquest style games, have been standardized in layout and materials offered. Not only will this set an expectation for what you will receive per map, where previously it was very different in some cases, but this also allows us to better prepare for custom kit layouts in the future.

Additionally, for each kill, players will always receive 1 golden apple, ⅓ of the arrows available in the spawn kit (with a minimum of 12 and maximum of 24), and ¼ of the building blocks in the spawn kit (with a maximum of 32 per block type). Knowing what to expect when you get a kill is incredibly important and having each different map give their own items in arbitrary quantities simply doesn’t make sense to us.

#### **Capture the Wool**

Wool rooms will now always be stocked with stacks of 64 golden apples, an armor upgrade (when appropriate), and a bow upgrade. Wool rooms will also now have ender chests containing the colored wool instead of standard shared chests. Each player will begin with 5 wool in their ender chest, and 3 will be added to the ender chest each time the player received a kill during the match. This limits the amount of wool available to players and forces players to strategically place safety wools instead of throwing them around like there's no tomorrow.

### **Public Maps**

For our public server, we want to close the gap between what is typically considered “public” and “competitive” play. For this reason, we will be providing a selection of maps comprised of slightly modified tournament-grade maps with community classics and favorites that still inspire friendly competition between players.

For the beta period, the public servers will have Capture the Wool (CTW), Capture the Flag (CTF), Destroy the Monument (DTM), King of the Hill (KotH), and Team Deathmatch (TDM) ready to play. King of the Flag (KotF) will be following shortly after. Domination (5CP) will be only available on private servers. A full list of maps will be made available on January 1st when the beta period begins.

#### **Destroy Changes**

Destroy maps have been the topic of lengthy discussions within and outside of our team. We have decided, for the time being, that cores will be replaced with monuments that are of equal or greater difficulty to attack and are unable to be tunneled inside of. We feel that the Destroy the Core game mode isn’t currently in the best state to be played, and we would like to spend more time improving the game mode before releasing it on our servers.

### **Submissions**

Our XML documentation will be made available to the public during the beta period and we will begin accepting map submissions from the community right away. Available on the documentation website will be all the available game facets and how to use them, technical guides, and templates. Community map submissions are greatly important to us, and while we appreciate new map submissions, if there are maps from other authors that you would like to see here on Walrus, let us know!

Thanks,

Walrus
