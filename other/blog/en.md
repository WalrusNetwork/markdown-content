Today we’re excited to be releasing a run-down of how we intend to implement punishments and rule enforcing. You can visit the policy up on our website [right here](/punishments).

Sit down with a glass of milk and a couple cookies when you’re next ready (we hope you’re not lactose intolerant), and have a read-through of our punishments policy. It is a slightly longer post than your typical read as the system does have a few tricks to it, but we want to openly and clearly communicate how we intend to enforce our service rules with our users.

We’re always open to your thoughts and feedback! The `#discussion` channel in [our Public Discord](https://discord.gg/eySJYEb) is a great place for those.

Thanks and happy Sunday!
Walrus
