Hello everyone,

Today we're announcing a few items to go live in our Shop on January 1st! You can view the pricing for these as soon as they go up in the Shop.

The Sponsor rank is your way of supporting us during our early Beta phase while we prop up the business on its two feet. It should be said that not all of the features below may be available to our Sponsor right upon the Beta opening date: however, we will do our best to implement as many of these as possible. Regardless, we want to see these features available to our Sponsors as soon as possible!

### **Sponsor Rank:**

- Gold Sponsor star in-game
- Reserved premium slots in running matches and match queues
- Perks on our Discord server:
  - Standalone Sponsor rank
  - Musicbot permissions
  - Private Sponsor channel
  - Create a temporary voice channel for you and your friends
- Max party size of 10 (default is 5): at most 5 players (default is 3) on same team for premium
- Cosmetics & Customizations:
  - Ares & Arena: 3 Hotbar loadouts per game-type (i.e. Ares and Arena)
  - Custom firework per player on objective completion (may be toggled)
  - Various lobby cosmetics
- Flying in lobby
- x1.5 XP reward
- UHC: join the whitelist early, and during the match countdown
- 3 free Map Votes\*
- 15% off all other items in our shop!

### **One-off purchaseables:**

We're introducing Map Votes and UHC Coins. We're also hoping to have these available at some point in time during the earlier stages of our Beta — so keep an eye out!

- **Map Votes** (MV): an MV lets you define 1 of the 3 maps that are voted on in order to determine the next map to be played. Of those 3 maps put forward by the system for the vote, you get to submit 1. Everyone votes between the 3, and the map with the highest number of votes is played.

- **UHC Coins** give you the ability to host your own custom-UHC match, using our plugin, the various scenarios available to you (more on scenarios soon!), and the multiple commands available to hosts helping them run their match as they so please. These matches won't be Reddit UHC games as the UBL will not be enforced during these matches — consider them like a friendly UHC that you can throw up and play with ten or fifteen of your friends!

With that being said, we have more premium features in the wraps that we're looking to implement! Our devs are jam-packed at the moment (and will be busy as ever with our Beta, as expected), but we'll keep you updated.

Wishing everyone a merry Christmas and happy holiday!

Walrus
