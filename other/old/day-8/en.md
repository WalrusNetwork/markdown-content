Today we talk about our vision for Arena and UHC! These games won’t be ready right at the start of our Beta release, but nevertheless we’re excited to share our thoughts with you and collect your [feedback](https://discord.gg/eySJYEb).

### **Arena Kits**

For the Beta, we want to start by offering a nice selection of the good’ol popular Arena kits that folks associate to Arena. Our intent is to bring these to a polished place, and then build on from there, adding more complex and original kits. An unusual kit we’d like to include as of Arena’s beginning is the cannoning kit. See below for a list of our starter kits:

- [Ares (‘OCN’)](https://imgur.com/a/918MyhY)
- [No Debuff](https://imgur.com/a/4xun1TD)
- Debuff
- Archer
- [Build UHC](https://imgur.com/a/48ckmsY)
- [Sumo](https://imgur.com/a/WQLHh9C)
- Spleef
- Cannoning kit

Kits above that don't are not linked still need work (cannoning) or will use the standard kits that other Arena servers use (Minemen). The structure of the cannoning kit and its maps have yet to be concluded on, and which kits end up being a part of the Ranked series from the above list will be determined closer to Arena’s launch. All kits that are Ranked will be featured on Unranked as well.

We’ve come up with some new exciting ideas to spice up kits & Arena as a whole! These new kits will potentially make use of an objective-component, and the terrain might play a much bigger role in the match (think about what an A/D kit could look like). We’ve also come up with kits that could improve specific skills that are specific to other games, such as bridging or cannoning kits. We’ll be looking to invest more time into these once our core kits above are in a good place, as these make up the foundations that Arena-players all know and love.

### **Post-match Stats**

Having an overview of how you did in the match is great to help players improve. Depending on the appropriateness of the kit just played, this overview might include the following statistics visible to a player:

- The health, hunger, and duration of active potion effects remaining
- The number of healing items remaining in the inventory
- The number of successful hits landed on the opponent
- The largest number of consecutive hits landed
- The longest distance for a bow shot
- The ratio of bow shots taken vs. landed (bow accuracy)
- The ratio of available healing vs. healing received (potion accuracy)

### **Reddit UHCs**

We’re excited to announce that we’ll be hosting Reddit-compliant UHCs! While not all of our UHC matches will be Reddit, a majority will be. We will also be enforcing the Universal Ban List (UBL) for any Reddit match. The Reddit ruleset can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/uhccourtroom/wiki/banguidelines).

### **Planned UHC Scenarios**

As for UHC, we’ve got a few scenarios in mind that we want to see on our server. The following list is not exhaustive, and we are still in the process of vetting our scenario list.
The scenario descriptions were for the most part pulled from [Reddit’s UHC host guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/UHCHosts/wiki/scenario_list):

- Cutclean: “Ores and animal drops are automatically smelted, no furnaces needed.”
- Timber: “Breaking a log of a tree will cause the whole tree to fall down”
- Hastey Boys: “Everyone mines faster”
- Golden Retriever: “Killing a player drops a golden head.”
- Bleeding Sweets: “When a player dies, they drop 1 diamond, 5 gold, 16 arrows and 1 string.”
- Timebomb: “After killing a player, their loot will drop into a chest. A chosen amount of seconds later (usually 30 seconds), the chest will explode.”
- Sky High: “After a certain period of time, you will take damage every 30 seconds if you are below y:100.”
- Moles: “One person on each team is chosen to be the Mole. The Moles are one team and can communicate with each other, trying to take out the other players. The normal players try to find out who the mole is on their team and kill them.”

We’ll further be looking to implement random teams and a dueling / pvp option in the lobby.

### **Conclusion**

We’re excited about what we’ve got in reserve for you with regards to UHC and Arena. While these games won’t be available as of the the 1st, our developers will be looking to power through them once Ares is in a comfortable spot. Progress has already been made, and we’re looking to fine-tune and polish these games before we release them.

We’ll be interested to see which of Ares, UHC and Arena our players will play the most, and what the overlap between each community will resemble! As much as we like to plan everything down to the wire, we’re also taking this is a learning experience for ourselves, and we’re stoked to see what comes out of these three well-maintained games within a couple months.

Happy Saturday and see you in the morning!
