Hello everyone!

We're stoked to say that one of the cornerstones of our Beta will be to make purchasable private servers available to players! While these won't be available right away, we want to see private servers up and out at some point through the Beta.

We can see maps from future games being available on private servers further down.

Private servers will feature a selection of Ares maps. Below is the current list of these that we are considering supplementing for our server owners, but this list could change.
