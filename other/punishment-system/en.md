# **Walrus Punishment System**

We want to be transparent and clear to our users in explaining how we handle rule-breaking, so this will be a somewhat lengthier explanation than the usual article. Let’s get to it.


### **Generalities**

We’ve designed a punishment system that is educational in nature. We know players don’t start by reading the rules or ToS when they join a server, so we want to give players enough time and a sufficient number of tries to consciously absorb and learn what the rules are and how they work, before we start actively punishing more harshly. Our policy is no third chances: you knew the rule fully well, you still broke it. You deserve to be punished.


### **The Tracks: Game and Chat**

There are two fully **independent infraction tracks: game (‘ban’) and chat (‘mute’)**. Based on how many rules you’ve broken, and how badly you’ve broken them (an accident is highly different from consciously circumventing a rule), the system places you on a level of the track. The higher the level, the longer the mute or ban.

See the graphics below for a full outline of both track levels.  Again: these are **independent**. If you get muted, you will not be banned (although a ban is practically a mute).  Your standing in one track is independent of your standing in the other, which is only fair: if you spammed in the chat, we wouldn’t necessarily want you banned from the server and unable to keep playing – rather we’ll let you play, but you just won’t be able to talk for a while.


### **Infraction Categories (The “C’s”)**

We’ve trained our moderators to recognize 1. The type of infraction (was it chat or game?) and 2. the severity of the infraction (how badly did you goof up? Was it accidental or were you really out to get someone?).  Based on the rule you broke and how badly you broke, a mod will assign 1. A type (ban or mute) and 2. A punishment category to your infraction (1 through 6, see the infographics below on how we break down infractions into categories).  The system will then consider your current level (which corresponds to the most recent punishment you received), and choose which level to then bump you to next, based on how naughty you’ve been.

**Example**: you were last banned for a day, and you again blow up your teammates’ chest (considered team-griefing and illegal).  A mod gives you a Category 1 infraction (Category 1 includes minor infractions, see infographic below).  The system will bump you up a level, to the 3-day ban, which is the next level on the track.  You are now banned for 3 days.

In addition, any infraction that is typical of a Category 1 (C1) or Category 2 (C2) punishment on either track will receive a warn if you have no previous infractions or warns for the specific rule that you just broke.  For example: you just spammed multiple messages for the first time ever (spam is illegal).  If the mod thinks this was C1 or C2 worthy, they will warn you for spamming, instead of punishing, because you might have not known about the rule.  The mod gave you the benefit of the doubt: now, you know better than to spam.  The next time you do it, a mod will punish you for it because you already learned about the rule and give you a C1 or C2.


### **Game Track: Levels**

Below is the extensive list of levels on the **Game** track.  These represent the duration of the **ban**:

1. Kick
2. 1 day ban
3. 3 day ban
4. 1 week ban
5. 2 week ban
6. 1 month ban
7. 3 month ban (info cheats & movement cheats start here)
8. 6 month ban
9. 1 year ban (combat cheats and Category 4 infractions start here)


### **Chat Track: Levels**

Below is the list of levels on the **Chat** track. These represent the duration of the **mute**:

1. 10 minutes
2. 30 minutes
3. 1h
4. 2h
5. 6h
6. 1 day
7. 3 days
8. 1 week
9. 2 weeks
10. 1 month
11. 3 months (Category 4 infractions start here)


### **Chat Track: Categories & Consequences**

Below is a breakdown of the **Chat** categories, and how many levels they will bump you up on the track:

- C1 is for a minor chat infraction.  A C1 will repeat your current level (if you were last muted for 30 minutes, you will again be muted for 30 minutes).

- C2 is for a standard chat infraction.  A C2 will bump you up one level.

- C3 is for extreme or excessive chat infractions.  A C3 will bump you up 2 levels. You are not required to have been previously warned or punished for the rule you broke before receiving a C3.

- C4 is for extreme harassment, threatening and violence. A C3 will put you straight at the 3 month mute level. You are not required to have been previously warned or punished for the rule you broke before receiving a C4.
    - `Note:`A Senior Mod may choose to extend the duration of a C4 mute after is has been dealt, or change the mute to a ban (extreme aggression and harassment fall under the C4 category).


### **Game Track: Categories & Consequences**

Below is a breakdown of the **Game** categories, and how many levels they will bump you up on the track:

- C1 is for a minor game infraction. A C1 will repeat your current level (if you were last kicked, you will again be kicked).

- C2 is for a standard game infraction.  A C2 will bump you up one level.

- C3 is for any extreme or severe game infraction.  A C3 will bump you up three levels (notice +3 here, whereas a chat C3 is +2). You are not required to have been previously warned or punished for the rule you broke before receiving a C3.

- C4 covers anything worse than a C3 (consider: DDOS of the server).  A C4 will put you straight off at the 1 year ban level. You are not required to have been previously warned or punished for the rule you broke before receiving a C4.
    - `Note`: A Senior Mod may choose to extend the duration of a C4 ban.

- A C5 will put you straight off at the 3 month ban level. You are not required to have been previously warned or punished for the rule you broke before receiving a C5. This is meant for hacks and unfair advantages (see the `Types: Unfair Advantages` and `Consequences: Unfair Advantages` sections of [our Player Rules page](/rules)).

- A C6 will put you straight off at the 1 year ban level. You are not required to have been previously warned or punished for the rule you broke before receiving a C6. This is meant for hacks and unfair-advantages (see the `Types: Unfair Advantages` and `Consequences: Unfair Advantages` sections of [our Player Rules page](/rules)).


### **Special Cases and Notes**

If you succeed (somehow) in getting yourself on the ‘highest’ level of a track, your next level is simply **double** the length of your current level. For instance, if you were last muted for 6 months and you *again* say something to get yourself punished (at that point, what are you doing buddy?), you would 6 months x 2 = 1 year mute.  The next would be 2 years, then 4 years, and so on…

If the system finds that you are accumulating many punishments or warns **within a short duration of time**, the punishment system will place you on a higher level of the track, quicker.  This is because we consider that you could not possibly be racking up this many punishments or warns so quickly without malintent in mind.

**One more thing: the system rewards you for good conduct!** After a certain period of time (we won’t say when), punishments decay and your level sinks back down on the track.  Some extreme punishments may not decay however (C4 punishments).


### **Concluding Thoughts**

Good job making it through this explanation.  We think the system is both friendly enough to new players, giving any player sufficient wiggle-room to learn what the rules are, before the player starts hitting harsher punishments.

Regardless, if you read our service rules and use common sense in game, you will not get very high on either track – in fact, you might not receive any punishments at all.  If you get a punishment or warn: no worries; take it as a learning experience for the next time.  Be smart.
