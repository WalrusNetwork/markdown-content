# **Player Rules**
*Last updated: December 22nd, 2019*

1. Maintain a respectful and friendly behavior across our services.  Toxicity will be punished: nobody likes a downer.  Use common sense.  Anything inappropriate should be kept to private communication channels.

2. Do not accuse other players of rule-breaking or using an unfair advantage.  Instead, use the [/report](https://walrus.network/guides/faqs/how-can-i-report-a-player) command.

3. Follow staff instructions.  They are here to help and ensure players have an enjoyable experience on our services.

4. On our team-based gamemodes (such as Ares), do not:

    1. Team-grief: defined as being detrimental to your team in their efforts to win the match.  Examples are blowing up your team’s side, destroying your team’s strategic structures (skybridges or defenses), or otherwise harming your teammates.

    2. Team-spleef: defined as breaking blocks under your teammates so that they fall out of the world and die.

5. On our UHC games, do not:

    1. Cross-team: defined as teaming with another player or group of players.

    2. Stall Meetup: defined as playing in a way that impedes the progression of the game.

    3. Abuse F5: defined as using 3rd person perspective as a means of cave finding.

    4. iPvP: defined as trying to kill another player before pvp is enabled in the game.

    5. Excessive Stalking: defined as actively impeding the gameplay of another player before pvp is enabled.

6. On our Arena games, do not:

    1. Run away from the fight for a prolonged duration of time, in order to encourage the opponent to give up.

    2. Attempt to camp.

    3. Manipulate your elo, or have multiple accounts on the leaderboards: the statistics on your highest ranked elo account will be reset.

7. Do not hack or make use of any tools which give you an unfair advantage over vanilla users.  The following tools are expressly allowed:

    1. ToggleSprint (but not ToggleSneak)

    2. Optifine

    3. Mini-map which does not reveal entity location, only terrain

    4. Game clients such as Badlion Client, LabbyMod, Lunar Client, OCMC, 5Zig, Cosmic Client, PvP Lounge…

8. One physical movement of a body part = one single press of a button = one single in-game action (i.e. a single click).  Butterfly click at your own risks and perils.

9. Do not attempt to harm or bring down any of our services.  Do not exploit any bugs; instead, report them to a staff member.

10. If you are banned or muted, do not try to evade the punishment(s) on your main account with an alternate account.

11. Do not attempt to send or provide any phishing, pornographic, immature or otherwise inappropriate links and references on our services.

12. Do not advertise any other services other than those provided by Walrus LLC, without a staff member's explicit consent.

13. Do not attempt to impersonate any of our staff.

14. The senior staff reserve the right to enforce punishments on players at any given time, of any level of severity.


### **Types: Unfair Advantages**

1. We distinguish among three types of unfair advantages: Movement, Combat, Information & Miscellaneous.

    1. **Movement**: any tool which modifies vanilla movement mechanics (examples: flying, Speed, Glide, Spider, B-Hop, ToggleSneak, NoSlowDown, Dolphin, Blink).

    2. **Information & Miscellaneous**: any tool which provides more information to the user on the player environment than is available to vanilla users, or is a tool that does not fall under either the Movement or Combat categories (examples: radar, X-Ray, AutoBuild, Regen, AutoTool).

    3. **Combat**: any tool which provides for different combat mechanics than those typical of vanilla users (examples: modified knockback, AutoClick, Aimbot, Triggerbot,  KillAura/Forcefield, macros, Reach).

`Note`: Modified Knock-back is considered an unfair advantage of Combat type.

### **Consequences: Unfair Advantages**

Laid out below are the consequences related to the use of any tools which give an unfair advantage.

1. **Stand-alone Movement** and **stand-alone Information & Miscellaneous** advantages will be dealt a **3 month first-instance ban**.  **Stand-alone Combat** advantages will be dealt a **1 year first-instance ban**.

2. The **combination of Movement and Combat** advantages, or **Movement and Information & Miscellaneous** advantages, will all be dealt a **3 month first-instance ban**.

3. The **combination of Combat and Information & Miscellaneous** advantages will be dealt a **1 year first-instance ban.**

`Note`: We explicitly state “first-instance” here to suggest that these are the consequences for a first-time cheating offense.  Any repeat offenses (i.e. found cheating or with an advantage multiple times) will be dealt harsher punishments.


We've provided a friendly infographic for your convenience, summarizing the consequences associated with stand-alone and combined usage of unfair advantages:
