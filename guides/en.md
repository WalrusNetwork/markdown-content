## **Welcome to our player guides section!**

Have an unanswered question about who we are and what we do?  Experiencing an issue that you'd like resolved?  Wondering how you can contribute? You're in the right place.  The guides are structured in the following two drop-down sections:

- FAQs
- Map-making Corner

We hope these help. If you need assistance, please reach out to someone from our team. Moderators are available to answer questions and wear their red `MOD` tag in-game. You can also shoot us an email at [support@walrus.network](mailto:support@walrus.network), find us in [our public Discord server](https://discord.gg/eySJYEb), Tweet or DM us on [our Twitter (@Walrusnet)](https://twitter.com/walrus_gg/) or find us on [our Instagram (@Walrusinsta)](https://instagram.com/walrus_gg).

If you spot any mistakes or gray areas in this guide, do please reach out as we'd want that fixed! Email [marketing@walrus.network](mailto:marketing@walrus.network) or talk to one of our volunteers. Thanks! âœŒ
