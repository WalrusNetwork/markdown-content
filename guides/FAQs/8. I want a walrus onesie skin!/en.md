Aha so you've seen them around! Yes, you too may go about wearing the walrus onesie in-game and become one of the cool ones.

### **Step 1. Download the walrus onesie layer**

Download the image below by right-clicking and hitting "Save as...", then save it to somewhere on your computer:

</p>

### **Step 2: Get your current skin, and open Novaskin**

Have your own skin png at hand. You can download it from the [Minecraft website](https://minecraft.net), under your profile --> skins, by right-clicking the skin image and hitting "Save as ..."

Head over to [Novaskin](https://minecraft.novaskin.me/).

### **Step 3: Create a blank template**

If there are any skins currently loaded, delete them. Do so with any and all skins already on the skin avatar, until you have nothing left but the default black-grid skin:

</p>

### **Step 4: Upload your skin**

To upload your skin, click the "Open" button on the top-left corner of the screen, and find your skin PNG which you've downloaded from the Minecraft website. You can also drag-and-drop your Minecraft skin PNG directly onto the Novaskin template to upload it.

</p>

### **Step 5: Upload the Walrus skin over yours**

Same idea, click "Open" to upload the walrus_onesie.png that you've downloaded from above, or drag-and-drop it directly.

</p>

Make sure the walrus_onesie.png template is below your skin's template, on the top-right "layers" corner of the Novaskin screen. This will ensure that your skin is a layer beneath the walrus onesie, which is what we want.

### **Step 6: Download your new skin and apply!**

Click the "Save" button on the top right of the screen, download your new skin PNG file by right-clicking -> "Save file as...", and then upload it onto your Minecraft profile, on the Minecraft website.

You can also directly click the "Apply" button on the top right, which will lead you to your Minecraft profile: click the green "Upload" button.

You're all set! Flaunt your onesie to your friends and tell them that all the cool kids have tusks and flippers.
