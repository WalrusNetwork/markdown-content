Hm. Here are a few things that come to mind right off the bat:

- This might sound a little simple, but double-check that you're connecting to the **correct server IP: `play.walrus.network`**.  Typos happen to everyone.
- Make sure your **internet connection is stable**. Can you visit other internet websites in your browser?  Some **parental controls** block internet access on multiple or all applications – could this apply to you?
- **Minecraft logins might be down**, or **we could be experiencing issues**.  If our servers are in a tough spot, we’ll do our best to keep folks updated on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@walrusnet/) and via [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/eySJYEb).  You can check whether Minecraft is having issues at [Mojang’s Twitter](https://twitter.com/mojangsupport).
- You might have been **banned from the server** (oops), or maybe your IP address is blocked for some reason.  There could be a lot of reasons behind this (example: maybe your IP address is be associated to a set of bot accounts that we were attempting to block).  Reach out to a moderator, and they'll get someone to look into what's going on.
- **Ask for help!**  Reach out to a staff member in [our Discord](https://discord.gg/eySJYEb), tweet us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@walrusnet/), or email us at [support@walrus.network](mailto:support@walrus.network).  We don't want to leave you hanging, poor fella.
