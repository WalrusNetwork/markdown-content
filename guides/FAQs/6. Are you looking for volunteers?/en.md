# **Are you looking for volunteers? Where do I apply?**

Wow, thanks for your interest!  We rely on our wonderful volunteers to power this community and the work we do.  As a volunteer, we can offer you real time, hands-on experience in a variety of skillsets, collaboration with experienced peers, and an enjoyable side-position for you to occupy.

### **What should I include in my application?**

Good question! It depends on the position you're applying for.  Below are a few questions to pick from to help get you started with your application:

- Discuss any career moments relevant to the position you're applying for: who did you work for? Doing what?
- Do you have a portfolio of work you've made that you can show (if applicable)?
- What's an iniative or project you might have been working on lately that you care about?
- Tell us about any previous experience in the topic / role.
- What's your relationship with Minecraft? Were you part of any Minecraft communities?
- What motivates you to help feed the Walrus?
- Anything else we should know about that is relevant to our better understanding your application?
- We take CVs / Resumes, so you're welcome to send those in with your app as well.

### **Conclusion**

What you decide to include in your application remains between you and us, and we will keep confidential any information you decided to submit.

You can write your app up in a document and email it to us at [support@walrus.network](mailto:support@walrus.network) when you're ready.  Walruses enjoy **PDFs** in particular.  If your app retains our attention, we'll be sure to respond, but we're currently a little overloaded with things so please excuse us if we aren't able to follow up just yet with turned down apps.

Let us know if you have any questions.  Thanks for your trust and we're looking forward to reading through your app!
