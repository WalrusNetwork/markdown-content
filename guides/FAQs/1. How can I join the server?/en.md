### **Server IP: `walrus.gg`**

You're on your way to becoming a player! First, purchase yourself a Minecraft account and download the game.

Once you have Minecraft opened, click on the `Multiplayer` button. This should bring you to a page where you are able to connect to any server you like.  You can click “direct connect” and type in our ip address: `walrus.gg`

Another option is to click the “add server” button from the `Multiplayer` menu, which allows you to save a server to your list of favorite servers. Simply add the ip address to the “server address” field, and click done. You can now double click on the server to join and begin playing!
