# **I found a bug! Where do I report it?**

There are two kinds of bugs in this world: bugs that aren’t too serious, and bugs that could cause us real harm if revealed to the public or if in the wrong hands.

If you believe you’ve found a harmful, dangerous bug (be careful, some of them sting), please reach out to a staff member in private, or email us at [support@walrus.gg](mailto:support@walrus.gg).

If the bug isn’t too nasty (some bugs are even cute – I’m a big ladybug person), then you’re welcome to document it on our Discord ticket support system:

1. Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/eySJYEb)
2. Use the Ticket Tool system to open a support ticket, which we'll follow up on.

There are only so many of us, but there are many of you adventurous bug catchers, and we rely on you to help us keep the corners clean. Thanks for your help!
