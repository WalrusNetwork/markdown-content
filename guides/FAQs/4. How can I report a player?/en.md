# **How can I report a player? When and why should report?**

Good question.

There are only so many moderators around at a given time and we can’t have our eyes everywhere.  This is where our faithful community members (that's you!) step in: responsibly reporting rule-breakers, cheaters and other schenanigans to the moderation team, to get a mod's attention and resolve the issue.

There are two ways to report rule-breakers: you can do so both **in-game**, and via the **website**.

### **Reporting from A to Z**

**In-game**, simply use the `/report <Player name> <Reason>` command.

In your report reason, refer to the specific rule that the player has violated, and explain how they've done so.  Reports carrying more detail are typically much more successful at getting a moderator’s attention (for instance, if a moderator sees ‘hacks’ as a reason, which is a fairly common report reason, they might raise an eyebrow, but won’t be as inclined to investigate as if the reason is “Player just jumped up four blocks into the air and flew over across the void”).

No need to report a player more than once if you’ve just done it!  Our mods do their best to ensure that no report is left unattended or unexamined, so avoid smashing that report command.

You do not need explicit evidence if you are reporting someone in-game, as it is implied that the player is currently or has just broken the rule.  The idea is that the mod will hop on over real quick and catch the player red-handed.

**Web reports** are meant for situations in which no moderator was online to handle a situation during a time, when in reality we wouldl like that person to be held accountable.  You might have video or image evidence of someone breaking a rule and would like to bring our attention to the case.

It is always assumed that a web report will require a form of evidence, as no moderator was online at the time to see what happened with their own eyes.  Our team of mods can recommend various recording softwares based on your computer, but [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) is a favorite.  Upload your video(s) to [YouTube](https://youtube.com/) and make sure the video is `Unlisted` before publishing (an `unlisted` video is one that nobody can find through a regular seearch, without having access to the link, which you happily provide to us in your report).

A mod will then review your report and the evidence presented. If they think you made a satisfying case, they will issue the appropriate infraction.
