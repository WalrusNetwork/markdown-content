# **Who should I turn to for help?**

If you ever need help in-game, **ask a moderator!**  They wear a moderator tag in-game and should be easily noticeable.  Mods will be able to answer your question, and if they don't know how to, they’ll refer you to someone who can.

Mods are also available for you in case anything is wrong and you need someone to talk to.  They are helpers, advisors, and moderators, all at once!  We love our mods.


We want to keep an open dialogue between our volunteer team and our playerbase.  We don’t bite, so if you ever need help or have suggestions for us on how we can do better, feel free to tweet or DM us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@walrus_gg), send us a message over [Instagram](https://instagram.com/walrus_gg), talk to us in our [public Discord](https://discord.gg/eySJYEb) or email us: [support@walrus.network](mailto:support@walrus.network).

And we don't bite (actually I think walruses can bite – we'll get back to you on that one).
