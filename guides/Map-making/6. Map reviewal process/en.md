# **Map reviewal process**

There are multiple criteria the Map team considers when reviewing a submission. Here are a couple in no particular order:
- What kind of maps are currently lacking from our map catalogue? Does this map correspond to a high-priority need?
- What are changes the map requires to achieve its goal?  Are they too extensive to be worth it?
- Do the map aesthetics and theme support the map's intention?
- Is the gameplay successful in contributing to making the map fun?
- Is the map appropriately labeled as either a Tournament Build (TE – destined to be played in a competitive setting), or for public (regular matches)?

Ideally, we'll be looking to follow up with map-makers in their creative process, by giving our feedback and helping map-makers refine their projects.

We know this isn't an extensive explanation, and we'd like to add to it — so check back shortly while we work on this section!
