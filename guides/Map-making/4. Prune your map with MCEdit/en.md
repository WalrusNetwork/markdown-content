# **Prune your map with MCEdit-Unified**

*The following guide was authored on the [docs.oc.tc website](http://docs.oc.tc/guides/packaging/pruning_chunks), and we've simply reused the guide and made a few minor tweaks.*

We now need to prune the map, as skipping this step might result in empty chunks or blocks being left in the void, in various positions in the world (either you accidentally left a couple blocks out while building, or the world glitched and was created with some added blocks). The following guide was authored on the [docs.oc.tc website](http://docs.oc.tc/guides/packaging/pruning_chunks), and we've simply reused the guide and made a few minor tweaks.


### **1. Download MCEdit Unified**

We'll be using [MCEdit Unified](https://www.mcedit-unified.net/) to prune the map.  MCEdit Unified is available on Windows, Mac and Linux.

Here are the [MC Edit Unified GitHub Project repository](https://github.com/Podshot/MCEdit-Unified) and the [Documentation pages](http://podshot.github.io/MCEdit-Unified/docs/index.html), for further reference.

### **2. Select the region around your map**

Once you've downloaded MCEdit Unified, launch the client and find your save.  Select a region that is just large enough to contain your entire map.  Include at least a few blocks of empty space around the map.  You can click "Select Chunks" to see exactly what will be included in the pruned map.

`Note:` Do not prune chunks inside the rectangle, as this will make the map difficult to work with. A few empty chunks will make no significant difference in map size.

### **3. Click "Chunk Control"**

Click the `Chunk Control` button on the bottom right.

`Note:` You must be in "Chunk View" in order for this to work.

### **4. Prune and save**

Now you can prune the map by clicking the `Prune` button in the sidebar on the left. Thatâ€™s it! Your map is now pruned. Save with `CTRL+S`, then you can close MCEdit. Be sure to remove any folders or files generated by MCEdit.
