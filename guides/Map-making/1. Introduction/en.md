# **Welcome to the map-making corner!**

Welome, adventurous youngling!  If you've found your way here, it's maybe because you want to make a map and have it up on the Walrus servers for you and your friends to play on.  Or you might just be a curious explorer of the web.  Great to have ya!

The maps available on our servers are made by both community members and our volunteers.  If you've ever had a good map idea, and you want to build it and see if it can be loaded to the network, then you're in the right place.

If you own a map that was made under PGM, that is not in our catalogue of maps, and which you would like to submit to Walrus, have a look at the ["Convert your PGM map"][1] page on our documentation website.

## **Make a map: steps A to Z**

Let's go through all of the steps required to get your map submitted and potentially loaded, from the idea to the final submission:

1. You've got a map idea. Great! Or you don't have one yet, but you wana start building: also great!
2. You need to build your map somewhere, so let's get you set up on your own local server, with the map-making tools installed: [Set up a map-making workspace][2]
3. [Create a void world][3] using Multiverse Core and build away!
4. [Prune your map with MCEdit Unified][4]
5. Write the XML for your map:Â see the [Walrus XML Documentation Pages][5]
6. [Package and submit your map][6]
7. Find out about the [map reviewal process][7] and how we work with map-makers to give feedback on and refine their map, or load it up to the server
8. Your map is loaded and in production! Learn about next possible steps: [Production & updates][8]
